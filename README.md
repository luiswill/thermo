# thermo
This project simulates a thermometer for your home
You can change the temperature whenever you want, limits (min: 0°, max: 45° will be added)
You can also look what value it would be in Fahrenheit, 
but if you set the temp, it will be back in Celsius again,
because this is the world´s most used temperature

You have to log in to set the temperature
the temperature change is saved in a csv file

The outside temperature is displayed in a little window, so you see how cold/warm it is where you live
