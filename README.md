PROJECT NAME
----------------------
 Thermo app


DESCRIPTION
------------------------

This project simulates a thermometer for your home.

You can change the temperature whenever you want (but you must be logged in as an admin to do so).
The maximum temperature is 40Â°C, the minimum 0Â°C.
You can also switch between the value in Â°C to Â°F, but if you re-change the temp, it will be shown in Celsius again.

Temperature changes are saved in a csv file.

The outside temperature is displayed in a little window, so you see how cold/warm it is where you live. 
You can also change the city you want to see the temperature of without being logged in.
